Zeros will be produced by multiplying 2 and 5.
Count no. of 2 and 5 in all prime factors.
No. of 2s is always greater than no. of 5s, because 2 comes 3 times before 5.
1
2 -> 1
3
4 -> 2
5 -> 1
So, problem reduces just to count no. of 5s in prime factors.
Also consider 25, 125 etc. which have more than one 5.
